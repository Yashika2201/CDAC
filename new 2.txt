hollywood principle
 1."Don't Call Us, We'll Call You.
 2.Dependency Inversion Principle:depend on abstraction,never on details.
 3.This principle defines the IOC with more abstraction.
 As you know IoC defines inversing the control of dependencies. 
 So first of all you should have a control center responsible for controlling dependencies i.e for making instance of them. 
 This control center then inverses the flow of making instance of classes. 
 So when you want to use ClassA in ClassB, you won't create instance of ClassB then Call ClassA. 
 You make instance of ClassA and pass it to ClassB using different techniques and use it.
